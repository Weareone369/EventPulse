            <h2>Welcome to Burning Man</h2>
            <p>A week-long experiment in temporary community dedicated 
                to art, self-expression, and self-reliance.</p>

            <h2>About Burning Man</h2>
            <p>Burning Man is an annual gathering that takes place at Black Rock City - 
                    a temporary city erected in the black Rock Desert in Nevada.
                     It was first held in San Francisco on Baker Beach. The event started with the spontaneous 
                     burning of an 8-foot wooden effigy of a man as a small function. 
                     Organized and co-founded by Larry harvey and Jerry James in 1986. 
                     Since then, it has grown into a cultural phenomenon attracting 
                     tens of thousands of participants every year.</p>
