        <h2> About Burning Man</h2> 
        
        <h2> Hisotry/Timeline</h2>

            <p>The initial act of burning the wooden man was an impromptu expression of 
            creativity and a way for Harvey to process personal experiences.
            Larry Harvey described it as an act of "radical self-expression" and a "spontaneous act of creativity." 
            The gathering of friends and onlookers who joined to witness the burning transformed it into a communal 
            experience, sparking the idea for what would eventually become the Burning Man festival.</p>
                
            <p>Over time, the event grew into a larger gathering that attracted artists, free spirits, 
                and those seeking an alternative cultural experience. In 1990, the event moved to the Black Rock Desert 
                in Nevada, where it continued to evolve, guided by principles that emphasize community, self-expression, 
                and environmental responsibility.</p>
                
                <p>The history of Burning Man is marked by significant milestones and evolution over the decades. 
                    Below is a timeline outlining the key events in Burning Man’s history: 1980s: The Origins</p>

                and burn it on Baker Beach in San Francisco on the Summer Solstice. Around 20 friends gather for this spontaneous act.</p> 
                
                <p>1987-1989 • Annual Beach Burnings: The event grows slightly each year, with more people gathering at Baker Beach
